  I am currently a Senior Statistical Programmer at the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research and Prevention (<a href = "https://www.fredhutch.org/en/research/divisions/vaccine-infectious-disease-division/research/biostatistics-bioinformatics-and-epidemiology/statistical-center-for-hiv-aids-research-and-prevention.html">SCHARP</a>) at Fred Hutch.
<br><br>
  	From 2010 - 2019 I was a Statistical Programmer at the Center for Veterinary Biologics, USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). 
  	<br><br>
	In 2013, I received a dual-major PhD in the interdisciplinary programs of Bioinformatics and 
	Computational Biology (BCB) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from <a href = 
	"http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State 
	University</a>. <br><br>
	My undergraduate education was in Biochemistry and Math. Prior to grad school, 
	I worked for five (5) years at <a href = "https://www.bloodworksnw.org/" 
	title ="Donate a pint - save 3 lives!"> Bloodworks NW </a>, (previously Puget Sound Blood Center ) testing donor blood products in a cGMP, FDA-regulated environment.
	<br><br>
	My main interest is developing analytical systems that help scientists and researchers 
	do their job more effectively. I primarily program in R, but routinely use python, 
	java, html/css, LaTeX and VBA to create accessible working environments.
	<br><br>
	I am also interested in leveraging interactive visualization for the reduction of 
	cognitive load during exploratory analysis.
