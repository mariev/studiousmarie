<div id="statement">
	I received my PhD in the interdisciplinary programs of Bioinformatics and 
	Computational Biology (BCB) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) from <a href = 
	"http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State 
	University</a> in Summer 2013. Currently I work with the Statistics Section at USDA 
	APHIS as a Statistical Programmer.
	My background is in Biochemistry and Math. Prior to grad school, 
	I worked for five (5) years at <a href = "http://psbc.org/home/index.htm" 
	title ="Donate a pint - save 3 lives!"> Puget 
	Sound Blood Center</a>, testing donor blood products.
	<br><br>
	My main interest is developing analytical systems that help scientists and researchers 
	do their job more effectively. I primarily program in R, but routinely use python, 
	java, html/css, LaTeX and VBA to create accessible working environments.
	<br><br>
	I am also interested in leveraging interactive visualization for the reduction of 
	cognitive load during exploratory analysis.
