<div id="statement">
	<p> I am a PhD student in the interdisciplinary programs of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) at Iowa State University. My background is in Biochemistry and Math. Prior to grad school, I worked for five (5) years at the Puget Sound Blood Center, testing donor blood products.
	<br><br>
My main interest is developing analytical systems that help scientists and researchers do their job more effectively. I primarily program in R, but routinely use python, java, html/css, LaTeX and VBA to create accessible working environments.
	<br><br>
I am also interested in leveraging interactive visualization for the reduction of cognitive load during exploratory analysis.</p>
