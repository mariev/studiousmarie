Now that Windows 8 has been released, local IT decided it would be a good time to upgrade OS to win7. 
I could winge about a lot of things related to IT around here, but that's just wasted effort. Really, I'm
grateful that they chose to skip Vista and in all likelihood will skip Windows 8. 

One thing I really liked about XP was the ability to auto-sync network files. This meant that when working from 
home (or more commonly in a conference room), I never worried about "preparing" for off-network functionality.
No copying files to the C: drive and moving them back later. No worries about losing changes. And no worries about 
finding out I'm missing an "essential" file at a critical moment. Anyone who has dealt with sluggish VPN connectivity
or has to navigate multiple levels of access to a wifi network can sympathsize. Anyways, I digress.

Win7 appears to have this same functionality: the "Sync Center". Which does not play well with the R function
