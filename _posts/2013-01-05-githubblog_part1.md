This site is hosted via github pages. In a nutshell: easier, faster, 
free. Who doesn't like free?

One downfall of this system is it seems that documentation is spread 
out - github, jekyll, liquid, plus navigating the various plugins and 
a custom domain. I'm documenting the adventure here in hopes that my
experience will make life easier for someone else. At the very least, 
a resource for troubleshooting.

1. Repo set up
	* If you don't already have a github account, sign up [here](http://github.com). 
	There is [minimal] software to download, and some set up. 
	[Documentation here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).
	* Create a new repo. Name it : *your-github-username*.github.com
	* In the repo, create a branch named *gh-pages*. Delete the master branch
	


2. Install Jekyll   
3. Sign up for a comment manager (optional)   
4. Set up directory structure   

Next ....<br>
