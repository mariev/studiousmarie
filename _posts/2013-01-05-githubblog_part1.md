This site is hosted via github pages. In a nutshell: easier, faster, 
free. Who doesn't like free?

One downfall of this system is it seems that documentation is spread 
out - github, jekyll, liquid, plus navigating the various plugins and 
a custom domain. I'm documenting the adventure here in hopes that my
experience will make life easier for someone else. At the very least, 
a resource for troubleshooting.




1. Sign up for a github account   
2. Install Jekyll   
3. Sign up for a comment manager (optional)   
4. Set up directory structure
